# econda_recommendationexp

This is an unofficial port of the official Magento-extension to Magento 2.

Original extension: https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/econda-cross-sell.html


## knonw bugs

This extension has the same bugs and features as the original extension.

The things I know so far:

* the creation of the category feed only works in certain scenarios as you have to use a store ID to get the categories
* maybe there are problems with i18n
* all the feeds are created synchronously


## Disclaimer

This extension is not supported and provided as is.

If you have questions regarding the port please send me an email to peter@codekunst.com.
